// Font converted from gcode generated with free stick fonts at:
// http://ncplot.com/stickfont/stickfont.htm

// To save memory, the move commands are stores in PROGMEM.
// Each move command consists of two 16bit shorts (one for x, one for y)
// The highest bit (0x8000) of x indicates if the laser should be on
// and needs to be masked by the drawing code.
